Djangogo is a Django project starter with a few extra opinions. They are:
- git
- gunicorn
- dotenv
- postgres
- whitenoise
- security (we assume SSL will be handled by a proxy server)
- helper script for above & more
- create a single app

Djangogo has been tested with:
- Django 4.1.7
- Python 3.10.7
